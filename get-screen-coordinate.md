## How to get specific (x,y) coordinates on a screen

In **macOS**, the function is built-in. You only have to do `cmd + shift + 4` and press `escape` when you're done.<br>
In **Windows**, I found a free and lightweight application called [mousepos](http://www.adminsehow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MousePos.exe) that will do exactly that. *(source: [Admins eHow](http://www.adminsehow.com/2012/03/realtime-mouse-position-monitor-tool/))*
